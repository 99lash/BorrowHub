## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to maintain a respectful and professional environment. Be constructive in code reviews, open to feedback, and considerate of other contributors' time and effort.

---

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/borrowhub.git
   cd borrowhub
   ```
3. Set the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo-owner/borrowhub.git
   ```
4. Open the project in Android Studio and sync Gradle dependencies.
5. Make sure the project builds and runs successfully before making any changes.

## Branching Strategy

BorrowHub uses the following branch naming convention:

| Branch Type | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Feature | `feature/<short-description>` | `feature/borrow-request-form` |
| Bug Fix | `fix/<short-description>` | `fix/return-date-null-crash` |
| Improvement | `improve/<short-description>` | `improve/inventory-list-performance` |
| Hotfix | `hotfix/<short-description>` | `hotfix/login-auth-error` |

Always branch off from `master` (or the designated `dev` branch if applicable):

```bash
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

---

## Commit Message Convention

Use clear, descriptive commit messages following this format:

```
<type>: <short summary>
```

### Types

| Type | When to Use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `style` | Formatting, naming, no logic change |
| `docs` | Documentation updates |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build process, dependency updates |

### Examples

```
feat: add borrow request approval screen
fix: resolve null pointer on item return flow
refactor: move data fetching logic to repository layer
docs: update README with architecture diagram
```

> For more detailed conventional commits, refer to **[conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)**.

## Coding Standards

### General

- Use **Java** as the primary language.
- Keep functions short and focused — one function, one responsibility.
- Avoid hardcoded strings; use `strings.xml` for all user-facing text.
- Remove unused imports, variables, and commented-out code before submitting a PR.

### Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Classes | PascalCase | `BorrowViewModel` |
| Functions / Variables | camelCase | `fetchBorrowRecords()` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_BORROW_DAYS` |
| XML Layout Files | snake_case | `fragment_borrow_list.xml` |
| XML IDs | snake_case | `tv_item_name`, `btn_submit` |

### XML Layout Prefix Conventions

| Prefix | View Type |
|---|---|
| `tv_` | TextView |
| `btn_` | Button |
| `et_` | EditText |
| `rv_` | RecyclerView |
| `iv_` | ImageView |
| `pb_` | ProgressBar |

## MVVM Architecture Guidelines

BorrowHub strictly follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern. All contributors must adhere to the following rules:

### View (Activity / Fragment)
- Observes `LiveData` from the ViewModel.
- Does **not** contain business logic or direct data access.
- Passes user interactions (clicks, inputs) to the ViewModel via method calls.

### ViewModel
- Holds and exposes UI state via `LiveData` or `StateFlow`.
- Contains presentation logic only.
- Does **not** hold references to `Context`, `Activity`, or `Fragment`.
- Calls Repository methods to request or modify data.

### Repository
- Acts as the single source of truth for all data.
- Decides whether to use local (Room/SQLite) or remote (Firebase/API) data.
- Does **not** contain UI-related logic.

### Entity
- Annotated data classes representing database entities (e.g., `BorrowRecord`, `Item`, `User`).
- Also acts as a model.

> Do not bypass the architecture by calling data sources directly from the View or ViewModel. Always route through the Repository.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with the base branch before opening a PR:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

2. Make sure the project **builds without errors** and all existing functionality is working.

3. Open a Pull Request against the `master` (or `dev`) branch and use our **[Pull Request Template](PR_TEMPLATE.md)**. Ensure you include:
   - A clear and descriptive PR title
   - A summary of the changes made
   - Reference to the related issue (if applicable), e.g., `Closes #12`

4. Request a review from at least one team member.

5. Address all review comments before the PR is merged.

6. Do **not** merge your own Pull Request without approval.
